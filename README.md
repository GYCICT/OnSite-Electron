# Onsite Kiosk v2.0.0 #
The entire front-end of the GYC Kiosk has been rewritten in TypeScript with the React & Electron frameworks. 
This new iteration of the kisok is state-based, which means there should no longer be any page reloading which seemed to cause previous versions of the application to hang.
The UI has been rebuilt with the MUI component library, and features some more comprehensive error handling.
